cplusplus: Streams
 A stream is an entity where a program can either insert or extract characters to/from
 streams are a source/destination of characters, and that these characters are provided/accepted sequentially (i.e., one after another).
 Streams -- https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/
 Check what you have been given: Only very simple programs should rely on values extracted directly from cin without further checking.
 we separate the process of getting user input from its interpretation as data, allowing the input process to be what the user expects, and at the same time gaining more control over the transformation of its content into useful data by the program.

Can l use getline();
